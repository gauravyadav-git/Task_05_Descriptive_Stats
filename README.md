# Task_05_Descriptive_Stats

This repository contains my submission for **Research Task 05: Descriptive Statistics and LLMs**. The goal of this task was to analyze a small dataset using descriptive statistics and compare that with how a Large Language Model (ChatGPT) interprets and answers natural language questions based on the same data.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- **Dataset Used**: Premier League 2022â€“23 season (not uploaded per assignment instructions)
- **Scope**: Used only the first 10 rows to fit within LLM input limits
- **Grouping**: No grouping used in this task; grouping by `stadium` will be explored in Task 06
- **Model Used**: ChatGPT (GPT-4)
- **Descriptive Statistics**:
  - Calculated mean, min, max, standard deviation, count, and most frequent value
  - Generated bar plots for 4 selected numeric columns
- **Prompt Design**:
  - Created 10 questions across 5 categories (Easy to Coaching Insight)
  - Used Python for validating answers to questions 5â€“8
  - Questions 9â€“10 are narrative and answered only by the LLM

---

## ðŸ§  Evaluation Method

- Answers to questions 1â€“4 were verified using the output from the summary file.
- Python scripts were written to calculate true answers for questions 5â€“8.
- LLM responses were evaluated manually and logged in `qa_results.xlsx`.
- Narrative insight questions (9â€“10) were not evaluated numerically.
